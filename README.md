##Before We Begin...
 - Aeroquad: Open source multicopter firmware. [https://github.com/AeroQuad/AeroQuad](https://github.com/AeroQuad/AeroQuad)
 - The code is a little raw. There are few comments and it can be difficult to follow. It's not the prettiest.
 - The goal is to demonstrate critical thinking, problem solving, and practical application of a software solution.
